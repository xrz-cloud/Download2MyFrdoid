We’re excited to report that we’ve delivered on the [App Profile feature we promised 5 months ago](https://t.me/KernelSU/44)! In this release, we have added an important feature to App Profile: Templates. You can create templates by yourself, import templates created by others, or directly use online templates. Templates can be directly applied to App Profile, without having to manually set each configuration! Therefore, even if you don’t understand the complex concepts in App Profile, you can easily restrict ROOT permissions through templates. In addition, welcome to [contribute rules to online templates](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/tree/main/website/docs/public/templates)!
